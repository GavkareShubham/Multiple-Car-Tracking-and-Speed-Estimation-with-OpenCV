# Multiple-Car-Tracking-and-Speed-Estimation-with-OpenCV
This code uses OpenCV to detect and track multiple cars in a video, estimate their speeds, and handle new detections dynamically. It employs Haar Cascades for initial car detection and KCF trackers for ongoing tracking, providing real-time speed estimation and tracking accu
